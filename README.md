**Don't use it in online game modes!**

[What is Cheat Table?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheat_Engine#Cheat_Tables)

```
"Cheat Tables" is a file format used by Cheat Engine to store data such as cheat addresses, scripts including Lua scripts and code locations
```

I recommend to use [Cheat Engine 7.3](https://cheatengine.org/downloads.php) or newer for the FIFA 22 cheat table.

The FIFA 22 Career Mode Cheat Table allows you to modify many aspects of you career mode.
For example you can edit players (potential, attributes, name etc.), transfer budget, boost/nerf players development, play single career for more than 15 seasons, change weather/stadium/time of the day before match, send youth academy scout to any country... and many more!

This cheat table has also an graphical user interface (GUI) which makes editing a little bit easier for inexperienced users.
